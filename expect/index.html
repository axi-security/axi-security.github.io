        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Arm Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol is a
widely used on-chip interconnect for processors, accelerators, memories,
and other IP cores. Any bugs in the AXI implementations pose a security
risk to the chipâ€™s correctness. Buggy or non-compliant third-party IPs
can use AXI implementation bugs to bypass the security mechanisms of
the whole system. Identifying AXI implementation bugs is challenging
because the incomplete specifications allow room for implementation-
specific behavior in performant designs. EXPECT is a systematic approach
for analyzing AXI implementations to detect functional and security
violations. We use EXPECT to test seven implementations of varying
complexity, including the ones from AMD Xilinx and RISC-V PULP. We
identified 135 property violations. We sampled 10 of them to show seven
exploits demonstrating that an attacker can use these bugs to trick victim
IPs. Our exploits achieve outcomes such as using stale data, skipping
reads and writes, leaking intermediate data, and reading and writing
attacker-controlled data to attacker-controlled addresses. We evaluated
our exploits in realistic scenarios deployed on FPGA. We show that AMD
Xilinx protocol checker IPs miss 5/7 of our exploits.
